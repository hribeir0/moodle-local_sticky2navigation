# Sticky Secondary Navigation

This makes secondary navigation sticky.

## Warnings

This has NOT been thoroughly tested.

While [Stream Theme](https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_stream) doesn't need this plugin, you should check behavior with different themes.

Boost and (I assume) [Boost Union](https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_boost_union)are supported.

## Installation

1. Go to the Moodle plugins directory, select your current Moodle version, then choose a plugin with a Download button and download the ZIP file.
2. Login to your Moodle site as an admin and go to Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Install plugins.
3. Upload the ZIP file. You should only be prompted to add extra details (in the Show more section) if your plugin is not automatically detected.
4. If your target directory is not writeable, you will see a warning message.
5. Check the plugin validation report

The usual workflow. Please set up available options for a better end result. In most cases the default options will be loaded, but one should choose the best settings per each case.

## Project Status

There are no planned changes in the foreseeable future.
